# GREET_WTW_Viewing
This is a test for developing an app that can be used to visualize GREET WTW Calculator Results

indexdevelopment.html along with app1.js are development files that allow simply the feedstock to be selected via a dropdown menu to show GHG emissions for each LCA stage

index.html and app2.js allow for selection of feedstock and metric.

there appear to be some pathways that do not change the values or the plot - but many work.  Still needs a little debugging.
